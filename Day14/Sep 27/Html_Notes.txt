Web Applications : 
__________________

	These are the applications, that which are to be called from varoius places rather than where they are created. If you want to make any distributed or robust applications, then we need the help of web applications. 

You can create web applications in 2 ways as 

	(i) Scripting Langauges

		Scripting Languages are langauges that which are interpreted, during runtime they takes lot
			of time to execute. 

	(ii) Programming Languages 

		These are the langauges that which are compiled first, during runtime they takes very less time 			to execute. 


In Web Applications we can implement

	(i) Client-Side Scripting

		Enables you to access the application from the client system

		No Network traffic

		Execution will be faster 


	(ii) Server-Side Scripting 

		Enables you to access the application from the client. 

		Network traffic is High

		A bit slower. 

*** Drawback with client-side scritping *** No Security to data and code. 

*** Any intranet based application w.r.t. No security, please opt for client-side scripting ***

*** Any internet based application w.r.t. Min security, please opt for both client-side/server-side scripting ***

*** Any internet based application w.r.t. High Security, please opt for server-side scripting ***
