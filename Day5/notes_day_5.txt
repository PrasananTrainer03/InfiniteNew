Files : 
________

A file is a collection of data, that which allows you to store the output
permanently. To deal with files we need the help of java.io package. 

You can access the properties of the file, by using File class. 

File f1 = new File("filename");

getPath()

getParent() 

FileReader : Allows you to read data from the file. 

FileReader fr = new FileReader(fileobj);

read() : Used to read data char/char and returns ascii value. 

FileWriter : Used to write data into the file. 

write() : Used to write data char/char 

FileReader and FileWriter allows you to read data w.r.t. Unicode format. 

Means only the text information we are able to read. 

But, if you want to read data w.r.t. Bytes format, then we need the help of

FileInputStream 

FileInputStream allows you to read data w.r.t. Stream of bytes, as you can read
any text/images/videos/rawdata anything you can read using FileInputStream. 

DataOutputStream : Used to write primitive types into the file. 

DataOutputStream dout = new DataOutputStream(filename);

writeInt()
writeUTF()
writeDouble()
writeBoolean()

If you want to read data from the keyboard, then we need the help of BufferedReader 

BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));

readLine() : used to read one line of input. 

ObjectOutputStream : Used to store Objects. 

writeObject() : used to write objects into the file. 

If you want to read write custom objects then that class must be implemented with Serilizable interface.
