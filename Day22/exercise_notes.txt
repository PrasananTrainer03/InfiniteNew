Abstract class 

A class that which can be created, but not implemented and instantiated known as abstract class. 

Abstract class contains abstract and non-abstract methods, only abstract methods needs to be overrided by the derived class. 

Interface :

	Java does not support the concept of multiple inheritance, to achieve this we need
the help of interfaces. An interface contains method declaration, and the 
implementation can be done in the corresponding class, you can add more than 
one interface to the particular class. 

differences :
______________

An abstract class contains both abstract and non-abstract methods, where interface contains only abstract methods. 

Interface methods are public and abstract by default. 

Multiple Inheritance can be achieved by using interface. 

An interface can be called from anywhere to anywhere.
