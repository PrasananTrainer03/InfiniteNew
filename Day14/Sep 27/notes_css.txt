    Allows you to make look and feel for the given document. 

Allow you to design the page w.r.t. Proper ui and we have lot of properties to implement them. 

How to start with CSS

There are 2 types of CSS files as 

(i) internal CSS

	The CSS code and html will be present in same page. 

(ii) external CSS

	CSS file will be separate and html file will be separate. 

to call the external css file in the given html document, we need 

<link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" href="filename.css" /> 



If you want to use one css file across multiple pages, then we need the help of external CSS. 


To start with CSS, we need the help of 

<style>

</style>

In old versions, we need to tell explictily about styling. 

But after improvements, by default <style> tag takes css as default language.
