These are the applications, that which are to be called from various places rather
than where they are created. 

If you want to make any distributed or robust applications, then we need the help 
of web applications. 

You can create web applications in 2 ways as 

	(i) Scripting Languages

	(ii) Programming Languages 

Scripting Languages are langauges that which are interpreted, during runtime they takes
lot of time to execute. 

Programming languages are langauges, that which are compiled first, during runtime they takes
very less time to execute. 


In java, we can make web applications by using 

Servlets 

PrintWriter : Allows you to display values in any given environment.
